# Flocking with Obstacle AvoidanceThis project implements flocking for a large network of aerial vehicles. The strategy is based on the (elegant) 3-part distributed formulation proposed in:Reza Olfati-Saber, ["Flocking for Multi-Agent Dynamic Systems: Algorithms and Theory"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1605401), IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, Vol. 51 (3), 3 Mar 2006.The formulation involves three distinct terms:1. **Alpha-Alpha Interaction (alignment)** - encourages the agents to align in a lattice formation. The function represents other vehicles as "alpha" agents. 2. **Alpha-Beta Interaction (obstacle avoidance)** - discourages the agents from colliding with obstacles. The function represents obstacles as "beta" agents.3. **Gamma Feedback (navigation)** - encourages motion towards a static or dynamic target. The function represents the target as a "gamma" agent.When combined together, these terms result in an emergent behaviour that is refered to as "flocking". ## Initial results<p float="center">  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/flocking_network/blob/master/Figs/animation_worx.gif" width="45%" />   <img src="https://github.com/tjards/flocking_network/blob/master/Figs/animation_worx2.gif" width="45%" /></p><div align="left"> <p float="center">  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/flocking_network/blob/master/Figs/animation_worx3.gif" width="45%" />   <img src="https://github.com/tjards/flocking_network/blob/master/Figs/animation_worx4.gif" width="45%" /></p><div align="left"> <p float="center">     <img src="https://github.com/tjards/flocking_network/blob/master/Figs/animation_worx5.gif" width="45%" />  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/flocking_network/blob/master/Figs/animation_plane1.gif" width="45%" /></p><div align="left">
